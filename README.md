# Andr√©'s Video Production Tools
This is the place where I keep all my video production tools organized. I created this repo because I didn't have a good way to keep all this stuff in a single place. All the files and information listed here were scattered between different devices/computers.

I mainly talk about single board computers - including Raspberry Pi, of course, and other maker-adjacent topics on my YouTube Channel

## Python Scripts

### File and Video Bin Management

```folders.py``` - Script to create the folder structure that I use to manage files/bins when creating a video. First thing I do when I start a new video project is to download and run this script on the root of the project folder.

### DaVinci Resolve
I have a full blog post on how to host a full featured DaVinci Resolve project server locally! I host my DaVinci server on a Raspberry Pi but this works on any Debian/Ubuntu/Linux computer.

```resolve_backup.py``` - Interactive script to manage DaVinci Resolve server backup. This is a work in progress!!
