# Andr√©'s Video Production Tools
This is the place where I keep all my video production tools organized. I created this repo because I didn't have a good way to keep all this stuff in a single place. All the files and information listed here were scattered between different devices/computers.

I mainly talk about single board computers - including Raspberry Pi, of course, and other maker-adjacent topics on my YouTube Channel

## Python Scripts

### File and Video Bin Management

```folders.py``` - Script to create the folder structure that I use to manage files/bins when creating a video. First thing I do when I start a new video project is to download and run this script on the root of the project folder.

### DaVinci Resolve
I use a local Resolve server hosted on a Raspberry Pi. This Pi also doubles as my video editing NAS.

I have a full blog post on how to setup your own local Resolve server. Although I use a Raspberry Pi, this works on any Debian/Ubuntu/Linux computer.

```resolve_backup.py``` - Interactive script to manage DaVinci Resolve server backup. This is a work in progress!!

## Software

### Editing
[DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - Still can't believe this software is free. Considering buying the Studio version.</br>
[Subtitle Edit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit) - I believe every YouTube video should have accurate subtitles. This software uses [Whisper AI](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) to generate the subtitles and it makes it super easy to edit for publishing.</br>

### Photo and Graphics

[Adobe Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) - I've been using Lightroom since it's origina beta version. Nothing beats Lightroom when it comes to tagging and cataloging images. I do most of my photo editing in Lightroom</br>
[Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) - Because nothing beats Photoshop when it comes to editing images and creating graphics.</br>
[Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - I use it mostly for creating charts for my videos.

## Hardware
Here's a list of the equipment I'm currently using. The links below are Amazon affiliate links because... I gotta get something out of it. There's no additional cost to you but I get a small commission if you make a purchase through my links below.

Canon RP - This is the same camera I use for personal use. It has a bad rep but it's a great travel camera. 4K on this camera is pretty awful, but all my current workflow is in 1080p
